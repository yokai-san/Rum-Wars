                    Rum is one of the most popular spirits in the world but did you know its history? 
                    So what is rum, It's actually a liquor that's made by fermenting and distilling 
                    sugarcane juice, sugarcane molasses or sugarcane honey. Produced all over the world 
                    it became commercially produced in the Caribbean and American countries. The origin of 
                    its name is unclear but it is believed that it's got to do with Rumbullion. Rumbullion 
                    was a beverage made by boiling sugarcane stalks.
