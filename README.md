# The Dark Origins of Rum.

## Project Description 

This is a simple website bulit using HTML & CSS.

Rum Wars is a site that is bulit for history nerds, people who like finding out new facts about everyday ordinary things (i.e. people who are drawn towards weird and usual stories.), & finally drink connoisseurs. After learning about the history of rum there will be a drinks section, with a list of popular rum drinks. 

## Features

* #### _Navigation Bar_
  *   Across the whole website there is a fully responsive navigation bar that includes a Logo, a home button, type section, and a drinks section. It is fixed to the top and and is identical across the whole site to allow for easy intuitive navigation.
  *   This allows users to easily navigate throughout the site across all devices without frustration 

* #### _History Section_
  * The history section will be broken into 3 parts, explaining different aspects of rum's history. At the end of this section there is a link to the drinks page.
  * This section will be interesting and engaging, hopefully encouraging the user to continue reading, sharing the information and checking out the drinks page.

* #### _Drinks Section_
  * This section will provide users with a list of mixed drinks and cocktails containing rum.
  * The user will be given a recipe, along with a list of ingredients and steps on how to prepare the drink.

* #### _Footer_
  * The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites. The links will open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.
  * The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media.
  * The footer will also include a "subscribe to our newsletter" box in which they will add their email.
